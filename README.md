# Description
PoC with Vault, Vault Agent and key/value secrets management.

## Start Vault as Docker service in development mode

In this mode Vault only save configurations and secrets in memory. Only use this mode for some checks:

```
docker run --name vault -d --cap-add=IPC_LOCK -e VAULT_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN_ID=root -p 8200:8200 vault
```

export url and root token environments:

```
export VAULT_ADDR='http://0.0.0.0:8200'
export VAULT_TOKEN=root
```

## Start Vault as Docker service in production mode

This runs a Vault server with TLS disabled, the file storage backend at path /vault/file and a default secret lease duration of one week and a maximum of 30 days. Disabling TLS and using the file storage backend are not recommended for production use.

```
docker run --name vault -d --cap-add=IPC_LOCK -e 'VAULT_LOCAL_CONFIG={"storage": {"file": {"path": "/vault/file"}}, "listener": [{"tcp": { "address": "0.0.0.0:8200", "tls_disable": true}}], "default_lease_ttl": "168h", "max_lease_ttl": "720h", "ui": true}' -p 8200:8200 vault server
```

export url and root token environments generated after configuration (json tokens file downloaded)

```
export VAULT_ADDR='http://0.0.0.0:8200'
export VAULT_TOKEN=hvs.fwEWVE5LwluMEe9lmqvnqhBi
```

## Vault login

We can login in vault if we not export the VAULT_TOKEN environment variable:

```
export VAULT_ADDR='http://0.0.0.0:8200'

vault login <ROOT_TOKEN>
```

the root token could be generated in production mode or fix in development mode as previous

## Check Vault service

Check vault status

```
vault status

```

## Access to Vault UI

Go to vault root http uri:
```
http://localhost:8200/
```

Now configure vault ui production mode the first time in 4 steps

**STEP01: Configure root keys in emergency case. Set 1 and 1 in both attributes**

![vault-production-config_01](captures/vault_production_config_ste01.png)

**STEP02: The system create for us two keys. This keys will be used to login in UI later. We can download**

![vault-production-config_02](captures/vault_production_config_ste02.png)

**STEP03: Now continue with the Unseal configuration**

We must introduce the Key 1 created previously to finish the configuration

![vault-production-config_03](captures/vault_production_config_ste03.png)

**STEP04: We can login using the root key created for us**

![vault-production-config_04](captures/vault_production_config_ste04.png)

![vault-production-config_05](captures/vault_production_config_ste05.png)

The next times we can access using the root toke to authenticate as root. Is the system is stopped we must unseal again using the other token

![vault-ui](captures/vault_ui.png)

## Manage access methods in Vault

By default vault only activate the token access. We will activate the username/password method and create a new account for this method.

From Access Menu option click the button Enabled new method

![vault-methods](captures/vault_methods.png)

Select Username& Passrod option and click Next

![vault-username_password_method](captures/vault_username_password_method.png)

The new access method is showed in this list

## Manage accounts inside access methods in Vault

Select the username/password access method and create a new account clicking in Create user

![vault-username_password_method](captures/userna_password_credentials.png)

The new account is showed in the list of this method

![vault-username_password_method](captures/username_password_account.png)

Login with the new account using the username/password method

```
vault login -method=userpass username=masalinas password=password
```

## Manage vault agent

**STEP01: Write a Agant Policy**:

```
vault policy write agent agent.hcl
```

Where agent.hcl define the policies to have total access to any path inside kv secrets engine

```
path "kv/data/agent/*"
{
  capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete", "list"]
}
```

**STEP02: Enable the kv secrets engine**:

```
vault secrets enable -version=2 kv
```

**STEP03: Store a sample secret**:

```
vault kv put kv/agent/static app=agent username=agent password=sup4s3cr3t
```

Revover the secret

```
vault kv get kv/agent/static
```

**STEP04: Enable AppRole Access**:

```
vault auth enable approle
```

**STEP05: Create a role called agent attached to the policy callee agend previously created**:

```
vault write auth/approle/role/agent policies="agent"
```


**STEP06: Obtain a Role ID and Secret Id from role agent to authenticate the Vault Agent**:

```
vault read -format=json auth/approle/role/agent/role-id \
  | jq -r '.data.role_id' > vault-agent/agent-role_id

vault write -format=json -f auth/approle/role/agent/secret-id \
  | jq -r '.data.secret_id' > vault-agent/agent-secret_id
```

**STEP07: Start vault agent from configuration**:

```
vault agent -log-level debug -config=./vault-agent/agent-vault-agent.hcl
```

**STEP08: Watch results**:

After Vault Agent starts, this service will get the secrets configured in the template and create a simple htlm templat for then:

![agent_results](captures/agent_result.png)

**STEP09: Rotate some secrets and show the results**

Now we are going to change (rotate) from attributes in the secret and the agent will get it again and refresh our html template. To rotate a secret we will create a new version of our secret and change some particular attribute, for example the username

![vault_rotate_secret](captures/vault_rotate_secret.png)

When save this new version secret, the agent will detect this change and download the secrets again and execute the template creating a new one with the changes:

![vault_agent_rotate_results](captures/vault_agent_rotate_results.png)
